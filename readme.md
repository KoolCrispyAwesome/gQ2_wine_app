Welcome to winio! The app that finds the perfect wine to go with your meal. 

The way it works, is, the user selects one veggue, one cheese, one meat, and one dessert. The data is run through our highly-sophisticated algorithm, and outputs the wine that pairs the best! The app is also able to handle null inputs. Say the user only wants to pair the wine with a specific dessert, or cheese, well all they have to do is select only one item and leave the rest blank, and the app will find the wine that pairs the best with that one item. 

We highly value a great user experience, so we wanted to allow users to use our app without being bombarded with "Signup" messages. However, should a user want to save their custom match, creating an account would be necessary. We wanted to build a traditional (local-strategy) signup process, with name, email, and password, as well as an easy, more user friendly, OAuth strategy. And since Facebook is they most widely used social media platform, with more than 1.65 billion monthly active users (as of March 31, 2016), we dicided to use them to handle our authentication.

We wanted to reward our users who have created accounts on winio. As I mentioned earlier, users who have created an account are able to save their personalized matched to view later. 

We utilized a wide variety of technolgies to create this app. Including: CSS, Express, Jade, Jquery, Javascript, Knex, Passport, Node, and PostgreSQL.

Thanks for checking out our app! We hope you enjoyed it!

The winio team,

Kyle, Andrew, and Cristina
